        title: `1. Privacy and Data Protection`,
        content: `The system should protect user information so that it's not exposed to anyone who shouldn't see it. 
             This includes using encryption when people send data through the site (like when they register for an event),
             and making sure it's stored securely behind login systems.
             Only people who need access to manage events should be able to see private data.
             We'll also write up a clear privacy policy that tells users what we collect, why we collect it, and how it will be used.
             Users should know they're in control of their data.
        `

    {
        title: `2. Consent and User Testing`,
        content: `If we test the platform with real students or staff, 
         we'll make sure they know what they're signing up for.
         They'll be told exactly what kind of data is being collected and how it's going to be used.
         Participation will be completely voluntary.
         If minors are involved at any stage,
         we'll take extra steps to follow university and legal guidelines.

    {
        title: `3. Platform Security`,
        content: `We also need to think about security.
         The platform shouldn't be open to hackers or used in a way that puts users at risk.
         To help with this, we'll write clean code,
         use secure login systems,
         and test for common security issues like SQL injections or cross-site scripting.
         The site will also be monitored for any issues,
         especially if it grows over time.
         Events that might involve sensitive information,
         like mental health workshops or support sessions,
         will be treated carefully so users feel safe signing up and attending.

         we'll make sure it's legal to use and we give proper credit.
         We'll stick to open-source tools and follow their licence terms.
         All work created for this project will be shared fairly among the team,
         and any university rules around student projects and IP will be followed.

         including people with disabilities.
         That means making sure it works with screen readers,
         has good colour contrast, and can be navigated by keyboard.

         not just those who can see and hear well or who use a mouse.

         more rules and responsibilities could apply - like global privacy laws or moderation of user-generated content.
         So it's worth planning ahead to make sure it's scalable and stays ethical as it grows.
